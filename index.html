        <p>
            New students arrive at the university with no way of knowing how to get to class the fastest way, where to park, or what dining halls they should use. This causes students a lot of stress since maps will take you on the main route, which might be 10 minutes longer than a short cut or you donâ€™t know where other dining halls are, so they are stuck eating at the same one every day.

  The group worked together in order to brainstorm ideas for an app that helps students, especially incoming freshman. Students want a way to learn what the fastest, most effective way to get to class is. Maps will take you on the most known route even if it 10 minutes longer than a short cut. They also are nervous about where they are going to eat because they don't know all their options, or even where they are located. We also brainstormed about the gyms on campus students want to stay in shape and workout but dont know where all the gyms are, what times they open and close, as well as the occupancy level. We discussed how we would market this tool for students and how we would make it accessible for all. Our group even considered if their should be a social aspect to this tool where students can post clubs or events on campus. Next we talk about it as an app and how it could be created. We also addressed issues that would follow while creating this app. Finally discussed brainstormed if and what images would be added.
