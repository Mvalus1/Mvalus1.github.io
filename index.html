            New students arrive at the university with no way of knowing how to get to class the fastest way, where to park, or what dining halls they should use. This causes students a lot of stress since maps will take you on the main route, which might be 10 minutes longer than a short cut or you donâ€™t know where other dining halls are, so they are stuck eating at the same one every day.
